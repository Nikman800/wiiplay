# Wii Play Decompilation

A matching decompilation of Wii Play (USA, Rev 1, RHAE01).

## Layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `extracted/` | Data partition from the RVZ (`dtk disc extract`). `sys/main.dol` is the only code; no RELs. |
| `dtk/` | decomp-toolkit analysis: `symbols.txt` (13,068 functions, 301 named SDK/MSL/TRK), `splits.txt`, `split/` asm per auto unit, `units.tsv` (code unit ranges). |
| `main.elf` | `main.dol` converted to ELF32 BE PowerPC ET_EXEC with dtk symbols and `_SDA_BASE_`/`_SDA2_BASE_` (`tools/dol2elf.py`). |
| `src/`, `include/` | Decompiled C/C++ source and headers; `config/RHAE01/` holds the split and symbol ledgers. |
| `decomp/` | Optional local Ghidra pseudocode (not committed; see docs/SETUP.md). |
| `tools/` | Build, matching and analysis scripts (see tools/MATCHING.md and docs/SETUP.md). |

Key facts: entry `0x80006124`, r13 (`_SDA_BASE_`) `0x80442AC0`, r2 (`_SDA2_BASE_`) `0x80444B00`.
Language `PowerPC:BE:32:Gekko_Broadway` from Cuyler36/Ghidra-GameCube-Loader 1.3.1.

## Build

The repository holds only our own work; game-derived files are rebuilt from your own disc image
(Wii Play USA Rev 1, RHAE01). On Linux, with Python 3.9+ and ninja:

```sh
bash tools/reproduce.sh "/path/to/Wii Play (USA) (Rev 1).rvz"   # extracts the disc to extracted/
python3 configure.py
ninja                                                            # downloads dtk, wibo and the compilers
sha1sum -c config/RHAE01/build.sha1                              # build/RHAE01/main.dol: OK
```

Requirements, details and the matching workflow: `docs/SETUP.md`. Status and roadmap: `docs/PLAN.md`.

## Naming (game code + EGG)

`dtk/names.tsv` is the ledger: address, original dtk name, new name, module, confidence, evidence.
`dtk/symbols.orig.txt` is dtk's untouched output; `config/RHAE01/symbols.txt` carries the new names.

Rebuild: `build_index.py .` (asm index) → `extract_literals.py .` (needs `decomp/`) → `name_game.py .` →
re-apply to `symbols.txt` → `dol2elf.py` → `export_decomp.sh`.

Name shapes (address suffix keeps names unique and traceable):

- `Hky_80216A24` — module only
- `Hky_HkyGoalLeftWd_80217750` — module + the function's most distinctive string literal
- `Tnk_BasicTank_8035B100_vf14` — virtual slot 14 of the class whose vtable is at `8035B100`; the class tag is the
  most distinctive literal used by its methods. Inherited methods are named on the most-base vtable.
- `Wly_..._8035CC80_init_80291828` — non-virtual function that loads that vtable (constructor/destructor candidates)
- `eggHeap_800A3420` — EGG function inside the run of `eggHeap.cpp` assert anchors

Modules: minigames `Fsh` Fishing, `Hky` Laser Hockey, `Pnp` Table Tennis, `Duc` Shooting Range, `Tnk` Tanks!,
`Wly` Find Mii, `Cow` Charge!, `Bil` Billiards, `Bom` Pose Mii; framework `Sys`, `Snd`, `Gfx`, `Lyt` (layout widgets),
`Menu`, `Party` (Wii Play title/results), `Mii`, `Health` (strap screen), `HomeMenu`, `Mpe` (unidentified scene),
`RP` (framework, subsystem unknown).

Confidence: `anchor` (uses a module-unique string) > `bounded` (between two same-module anchors; link-order
contiguity) > `class` (own vtable methods agree) > `callgraph` (≥2/3 neighbours agree) > `position` (nearest anchor).
Module codes come from the game's own asset/sound names; the minigame titles are inferred from those assets.

Known tooling issues: `dtk dol split` cannot re-run on this DOL (it names two sections `.rodata`); the index uses the
first split's asm. REA's Ghidra session does not seed r2/r13, so REA pseudocode shows raw SDA offsets — use `decomp/`
for resolved small-data variables.

## Method names (pass 2)

Every game function now has a method-level name such as `Hky_Puck_calc`, `Tnk_Shell_ctor` or
`Party_Common_calc`, proposed by per-module review of the pseudocode (13 batches) and merged by
`tools/merge_proposals.py apply`.

- `dtk/methods.tsv` — final ledger: address, dtk name, pass-1 module name, method name, module, confidence
  (`high`/`medium`/`low`/`keep`), evidence note, batch. `keep` rows retain the pass-1 name.
- `dtk/classes.tsv` — 398 classes by vtable address with evidence; `dtk/proposals/` holds the raw batch files.
- Conventions the reviewers followed: `tools/NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md`. Inspect any function with
  `tools/fn_info.py show <addr>` (callers/callees, literals, vtable slots, pseudocode).

Treat `low` names as hypotheses. State-machine handlers were mapped from member-function-pointer tables in
`.rodata`; virtual-slot meanings for framework bases (e.g. `Sys_Scene` slots 15–20: configure, loadResource,
reset, calculate, exit, async load) were inferred from how callers use them. Shared helpers duplicated per
source file carry an `_<address>` suffix. `Mpe` turned out to be the RP audio manager (`Mpe_AudioMgr`), not a scene.

## Types, headers and typed pseudocode (Phase 3)

Every game class has a C++ header in `include/Pack/` whose size is checked against Wii Play's
allocations with the original compiler (`tools/sizeof_probe.py`, ledgers `dtk/types/*_sizes.tsv`):
framework classes in `include/Pack/RPParty/RPPartyCommon/` and `include/Pack/RPAudio/`, minigames in
`include/Pack/RPParty/RP<Game>Scene/`. Global data has names and types (`dtk/types/*_globals.tsv`).
The headers are turned into Ghidra types through CodeWarrior's debug info, and
`tools/export_typed.sh` writes typed pseudocode for all code to `decomp_typed/all/` (see
`docs/SETUP.md`). Every field and name carries a confidence tag ([H]/[M]/[L]).

`include/hky.h` is the earlier plain-C Laser Hockey layout, still used by the matched unit
`src/Hky/FieldWallIter.cpp` and the compiler probes until they move to the C++ headers.

## Status

- Game code (Phase 4): 487 of 491 units are matching C/C++ that rebuilds byte-identical code; the other
  4 are functionally equivalent source with notes (`docs/NONMATCHING.md`).
- Libraries (Phase 5): 636 of 637 units match (EGG, the RVL SDK, BTE, RVLFaceLib, HBM, MSL, runtime,
  MetroTRK, and all of nw4r except `ef_animcurve.cpp`, which is functional and marked).
- The build reproduces the original `main.dol` byte for byte. See `docs/PLAN.md` for the roadmap.

## Legal

This repository contains only source code, tools and documentation written for this project (plus the
CC0 and Apache-2.0 third-party code credited below). It contains no Nintendo code, assets or binaries.
To build, you need your own copy of Wii Play (USA, Rev 1); `tools/reproduce.sh` extracts the files the
build needs from your disc image. Wii Play is a trademark of Nintendo; this project is not affiliated
with or endorsed by Nintendo.

Licence: CC0-1.0 (see `LICENSE`), except `src/revolution/BTE`, which keeps its Apache-2.0 licence.

## How this was made

Most of the decompiled source, the headers and the tools were written with AI coding assistants:
Anthropic's Claude (through Claude Code), with OpenAI Codex and GLM models as additional worker agents,
directed and reviewed by the project's maintainer. Every function counted as matching was checked
mechanically: it is compiled with the original CodeWarrior compiler and must produce the original
machine code, and the whole build must reproduce the original DOL. The rules for acceptable source
("natural C") are in `tools/MATCHING.md`; places where the source still departs from them are listed in
`docs/NONMATCHING.md`.

## Credits

The library sources under `src/nw4r`, `src/egg`, `src/revolution`, `src/RVLFaceLib`,
`src/homebuttonMiniLib`, `src/MSL`, `src/runtime` and `src/MetroTRK`, and the library unit layout,
come from Rhae (https://github.com/akiramusic000/Rhae), a decompilation of the same DOL dedicated
to the public domain under CC0-1.0. Thanks to its authors.

Several library units were matched with help from other CC0-1.0 decompilations:
Petari (https://github.com/SMGCommunity/Petari, Super Mario Galaxy), pik1wii
(https://github.com/projectPiki/pik1wii), Forecast (https://github.com/doldecomp/forecast, the Forecast
Channel; the CalcRandomSeed shape in `src/nw4r/ef/ef_animcurve.cpp`) and bba-wd
(https://github.com/vabold/bba-wd, Big Brain Academy: Wii Degree; EGG const-ness). The Bluetooth stack under `src/revolution/BTE` is
Petari's decompilation of Broadcom's BTE. Those files carry Broadcom's Apache-2.0 notices (see
`src/revolution/BTE/LICENSE-APACHE-2.0` and `NOTICE`), with changes by Petari's contributors
(muff1n1634) and small build adjustments here (compatibility headers, prototype casts).
Thanks to their authors.
